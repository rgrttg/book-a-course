## Project context
A friend wants to sell her language courses online and has asked you to create a small website that allows to test how her booking process would look and feel on mobile devices.

### We need to collect follwoing data:
Anrede [Select]
Vorname [Input|Text]
Nachname [Input|Text]
Geburtsdatum [Input|Date]
Strasse [Input|Text]

ORT [Input|Text]
E-Mail [Input|E-Mail]
Telefon G [Input|Number oder Text]
Telefon P [Input|Number oder Text]
AGB [Input|Checkbox]
Newsletter [Input|Radio]
Bemerkung [Textarea]

## Learning methods
### You work alone 
and build a website consisting of one page with a course description, the booking form page and a confirmation page (a minimal of three pages). The booking form must validate user input and give feedback in case of invalid entry values. The site should look good on phones (mobile first) and on a desktop PC.
â€‹
### Plan, organize 
and build the website, using HTML, CSS, (Bootstrap 5) and JavaScript. Create the mockup using Figma. Then use VS Code, Live Server, Git/GitHub for developing and source control.

### Practice your 
Git/GitHub workflow with plenty of Commits and some Pull Requests + Merges.

Tipp: Apart from the usual main branch, use a development and feature branches.

### Finish your 
project, including the retrospective, at 15:15 of the 21. Dezember 2023. At 15:30 there will be a vernissage of the works in the classroom.
